\title{Tracking Objects Time Symmetrically}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\section{Submission of papers to NIPS 2017}

NIPS requires electronic submissions.  The electronic submission site
is
\begin{center}
  \url{https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/NIPS2017/}
\end{center}

Please read carefully the instructions below and follow them
faithfully.

\subsection{Style}

Papers to be submitted to NIPS 2017 must be prepared according to the
instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to eight pages
long, including figures. This does not include acknowledgments and 
cited references which are allowed on subsequent pages.
Papers that exceed these limits will not be reviewed, or in any
other way considered for presentation at the conference.

The margins in 2017 are the same as since 2007, which allow for
$\sim 15\%$ more words in the paper compared to earlier years.

Authors are required to use the NIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable
at the NIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the
current files and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may
be grounds for rejection.

\subsection{Retrieval of style files}

The style files for NIPS and other conference information are
available on the World Wide Web at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://www.nips.cc/}
\end{center}
The file \verb+nips_2017.pdf+ contains these instructions and
illustrates the various formatting requirements your NIPS paper must
satisfy.

The only supported style file for NIPS 2017 is \verb+nips_2017.sty+,
rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{}
  2.09, Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}

The new \LaTeX{} style file contains two optional arguments:
\verb+final+, which creates a camera-ready copy, and \verb+nonatbib+,
which will not load the \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of
package clash.

At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ option. This will
anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid review.  Please
do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they will
be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.

The file \verb+nips_2017.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing
your paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract,
and text of the paper with your own.

The formatting instructions contained in these style files are
summarized in Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and
\ref{others} below.

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas)
wide and 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch
(9~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing (leading) of
11~points.  Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout, and
will be selected for you by default.  Paragraphs are separated by
\nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no indentation.

The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold,
centered between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points
thick and the bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow
\nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and below the title to rules. All
pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each
name is centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's
name is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if
different address) are set to follow. If there is only one co-author,
list both author and co-author side by side.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

\section{Tracking as a min-cost-flow problem}
Out first strategy is to model the movement of the object in the video as a flow which is minimal with respect to some costs.
\subsection{Min-Cost-Flow programs}
Given a directed graph $G=(V,E)$ with edge weights $c$, edge capacities $\kappa$ and vertex supply $b$, the min-cost-flow problem (MCFP) is the problem of finding a flow of minimal cost along the edges of the graph, which respects the capacity constraints and manages to match up the vertices with positive and negative flow supply. As a linear program this can be formulated as follows:
\begin{align}\label{MCFP}
\min_f &\sum_{e \in E} c(e)\,f(e) \textnormal{ s.t.}\nonumber\\
\forall v \in V: \,&\sum_{(v,w) \in E} f(v,w) = \sum_{(u,v) \in E} f(u,v) + b(v) \\
\forall	e \in E: \,&0 \leq f(e) \leq \kappa(e) \nonumber
\end{align}
where the first condition ensures that flow is conserved and the supply and demand at each vertex are met while the second condition guarantees the capacity constraints. In the following, we will often write $c, b, \kappa, f$ as vectors of length $| E|$.

\subsection{MCFP for object tracking}
We construct the directed graph on which we want to compute a min-cost-flow as follows: The vertices are given by the pixels of the video in addition of an auxiliary node $t$, which serves as a sink. There are edges from a pixel to a square area of pixels below it in the next frame (pixel close to the borders of the frame have less outgoing edges). We call the length of the sides of this square window size. It should be an odd number. All the pixels in the last frame have an edge to the sink. The flow supply is one for every pixel in the first frame that belongs to the object. All other pixels have a flow supply of zero apart from $t$, which has a flow demand matching the cumulative flow supply.\\
The costs and capacities of the the graph are the output of a neural networks, which takes the video as input. \\
Given a min-cost-flow for the above described graph, we predict the location of the object in every frame by (a bounding box around) the pixels through which there is a positive flow. We can also associate a loss $l$ to a flow. This is done subtracting the the amount of flow that goes through the object in the last frame from the amount of flow that misses the object in the last frame. As a result, we get 
$$
\left(\frac{dl}{df}\right)_{(v,w)} = 
\begin{cases}
 1-2\cdot\mathbbm{1}(\textnormal{the pixel to } v \textnormal{ is part of the object}) &\text{if } w = t\\
 0 &\text{else}
\end{cases}
$$
In order to train the neural network, we need to know $\frac{dl}{dc}$ and $\frac{dl}{d\kappa}$. Given $\frac{dl}{df}$ as above and using the chain rule, the key is to find $\frac{df}{dc}$ and $\frac{df}{d\kappa}$. In other words, we need to find out how the optimal flow, the solution to the linear program \ref{MCFP}, changes with the problem parameter $c$ and $\kappa$. For this task we explored the ideas of \cite{AmosK17}



\section{Special cases of the MCFP}
We saw in the above section, that the approach of \cite{AmosK17} seems not well suited for our problem. However, to train the neural network, we need to provide the network with some update direction for its output. Instead of differentiating through the optimisation problem to obtain a gradient, we use a solver to solve the version of the MCFP problem and then update the parameters of the problem in a way that reduces the loss at least heuristically at the solution. Then we updated parameters as targets for the neural network. In our analysis, we specialised the general MCFP to two corner cases. This reduces the computation time and highlights different features of costs and capacities. The general MCFP could also be treated in a similar way.


\subsection{Shortest Paths}
We explored the situation without upper capacity constraints in some detail. In our MCFP the pixel belonging to the object in the first frame all have a flow supply of one and the sink takes in all this flow. Therefore, without upper bounds on the capacities, our MCFP becomes the problem of finding the shortest paths from the pixels that constitute the object in the first frame to the sink. One advantage of this approach is that there a fast solvers for Shortest Paths problems, such as the Dijkstra (if all costs are non-negative) or the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
\footnote{Due to the special directed structure of our graph, finding shortest paths }

(Note on perfromance and Message passing). These algorithms compute the shortest paths from all vertices to a given one. So by computing all the shortest paths to the sink, we have solved our version of the MCFP and obtain a prediction of the object's location in the last frame by the pixels through which the shortest paths starting at the object in the first frame pass. Those paths that do not go through object in the last frame, have lost the object at some point. Therefore, we penalise them by increasing the cost of the edges along such a path by some fixed penalty parameter (a penalty which decreases for edges between earlier frames). One the other hand, paths that go through the object in the last frame are rewarded. The costs along their edges is reduced by the (scaled) penalty parameter.\\
The shortest paths algorithm gives the shortest paths from the background of the first picture to the sink for free. In order to increase the amount of information passed to the neural network, we also update the costs along the paths from the background to the sink. This is done in the same fashion as with the paths starting in the object, but in opposite direction: Paths from the background that pass through the background of the last frame are rewarded and those that pass through the object in the last frame are penalised.\\
One issue with this way of updating costs is that if a path that is penalised and one that is rewarded have a common end (they start in the object and the background respectively, but merge at some point), the rewards and penalties on the common end cancel. The possibility of the merging of paths itself could be an issue. If an edge has very small cost, it might induce several paths to use this edge and hence to merge. Without upper bounds on the capacities there is no possibility for two paths to separate once they have merged. So we might fear that  many paths merge at some point and that as a result the last frame is only passed at very few pixels by the paths coming from the object. This would yield degenerated predictions of the objects location which only consist of a few pixels. Fortunately, this does not seem to be an issue, as we will see in section REF, where we discuss the implementation of this algorithm. We suspect that using a convolutional networks saves us.


\section{Implementation}
We have implemented the shortest paths approach.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/sdamrich/FlowTracker}}  For the neural network we drew inspiration from the architecture of \cite{Lee17}. The network is a convolutional network with a shallow U-form. A ReLu layer follows each convolutional layer. As described in \cite{Lee17}, at first two 2D convolutions are applied. We use a kernel size equal to the window size of the graph. The 2D convolutions increase the channel number from 3 over 5 to 10. Padding is used to keep the original dimensions. The result is recorded, let us call it $X$ and a copy is 2D max pooled to decrease the dimensions of the frames by a factor of 2. Then, video is 3D convoluted to introduce that depend on the time structure of the video. The 3D convolutions keep the channel number constants.  First, we use a kernel of dimensions (3, window size, window size). So, the convolution sees a square area of length window size in three consecutive frames. It should be noted, that this corresponds to information being convoluted that comes from an area of side length twice the window size as we have pooled before. We apply padding to keep the dimensions. Afterwards, we use a kernel of dimensions (2, window size, window size) with padding to keep the latter two dimensions. As a result, we reduce the time dimension by one. Then we upsample trilinearly keeping the time dimension but restoring width and height of the frames to the original values, let us call the result $Y$. Before adding the 2D information $X$ and the 3D information $Y$, we convolute $X$ in the time dimension with a kernel of size 2 to match up dimensions. 
In the last step, we apply a 2D convolution layer with a kernel of window size, which gives out $\textnormal{window size}^2$ many channels. Here we do not apply a ReLu layer. We interpret the channels of the output as the costs for edges going out of a pixel. The code for this can be found in the NN.py file.\\
\\
The graph is built explicitly using the 
graph\_tool package. Since we build a large graph, we chose this performant package. \footnote{\url{https://graph-tool.skewed.de/performance}}

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper
nouns), flush left, and bold.

First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the
heading in bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the
heading followed by 1\,em of space.

\section{Differentiate KKT conditions}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.
Citations may be author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain
internal consistency.  As to the format of the references themselves,
any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations
appropriate for use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may
add the following before loading the \verb+nips_2017+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add
the optional argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{nips_2017}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the
third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et
al.\ [4],'' not ``In our previous work [4].'' If you cite your other
papers that are not widely available (e.g., a journal paper under
review), use anonymous author names in the citation, e.g., an author
of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote,
indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
  footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the
page on which they appear.  Precede the footnote with a horizontal
rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption
always appear after the figure. Place one line space before the figure
caption and one line space after the figure. The figure caption should
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are
numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure
captions and the paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in
either black/white or in color.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table
number and title always appear before the table.  See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical
  rules.} We strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package,
which allows for typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}[t]
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule{1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style
files.  In particular, do not modify the width or length of the
rectangle the text should fit into, and do not change font sizes
(except perhaps in the \textbf{References} section; see below). Please
note that pages should be numbered.

\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and
not, for example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file
must only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few
instructions to achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
  select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show
  All Fonts. You can also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes
  with \verb+xpdf+ and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux
  machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose
  fonts are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap
  fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You
  should use the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or
\verb+\mathbb{C}+ for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You
can also use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the
\verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we
will ask you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always
specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the
example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly
hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the
\verb+\-+ command when necessary.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments go at the end of the paper. Do not include
acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper.

\section*{References}

References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level
heading for the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable
as long as you are consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font
size to \verb+small+ (9 point) when listing the references. {\bf
  Remember that you can go over 8 pages as long as the subsequent ones contain
  \emph{only} cited references.}
